# Computer-Networks-Simulation-Analysis
This project is realized in Ubuntu 20.04 using NS 2.35 .You can grab the Simulation file here if you want to try it yourself. The analysis and simulation of MANET protocol AODV and DSR is done in this project.

# Essential Downloads

1. If you are a windows user you need to download ubuntu Os / for this we have an alternative in windows we can use ubuntu by installing virutal machine ðŸ‘‡

    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads .(You can refer yotube videos to install the virtual machine it quite easy thing compare installing new OS)

2. You can download the NS2 GUI Tool for analysis the trace fileðŸ‘‡

    I attached a File you can see above named JavaNS2.jar file.By clicking the file you can open the trace tool. (GUI Tool for analysis)

3. Final thing and Main is that you have to install NS2(Network Simulator).Its take lot of time to install based on your PCs performance ðŸ‘‡

    https://youtu.be/DiAqKK28Qn0 ( I attached a youtube video here you can get Complete guide to download all the stuffs related to simulation.by following the video you     can easily get NS2 installed in your VM).
    
    Watch it carefully and do the Steps accordingly.

# STEPS

I attached the Code for simulation of AODV and DSR you can see. By Running the ".Tcl" File it generate two things one is Network Analysis Module (NAM) and another file automatically created called Tracer file to Analysis. Using the NAM we can visualize the Protocol Working (Way of communicating). Then coming to windows you can open NsGTFA And load the tracer file and analysis the protocol according to the Node.

# NOTE:

1.NS2 works in Ubuntu.
2.NsGTFA works in windows.
3.You can change the parameter it will give different result. (we can change the nodes)
4.Analysis Made on Different node values on one protocol to Know the Efficiency.
